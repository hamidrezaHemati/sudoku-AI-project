backtracking and forward chaining:

after each value assignment to a node i should update the MRV of nodes
    - IF there was no 0 in MRV list, the new assignment was ok
    - ELSE there is a problem and that is a sign that we should start backtracking.
        + the problem is the last assignment (or assignments before that) was bad
        - we should look up to the path we take and find the last taken step.
            + in each Step in path there is 3 important attribute
                1. coordinate: coordinate of the node that we update it's value
                2. assignedValue: the value that we assigned to that node
                3.stepCounter: the number of step
        - after find the Step and extract its attributes
            1. set node.hasValue to False: set the bad chosen node hasValue boolean to False
            2. update the MRV of nodes again: to update the value domain of changed neighbors of that bad chosen node
            3. remove assignedValue from the domain of that bad chosen node: because that assignedValue was the problem from the beginning
               and if we assign that value to that node again then ( HAMON ASHO HAMON KASE همون آش و همون کاسه )
                1. IF the remaining values in domain of the node was >= 1:
                    its OK
                2. ELSE: we get FUCKED UP:
                    we should backtrack again
